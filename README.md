# ðŸŽ¡ fair compare

> You know... it's okay

Simple and easy comparison of images and text across whole directories, with no confusing frills.

## Download

Currently, this project is only available as source code. It is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app, so it should be relatively easy to run. Installers should be available in time, once the app is a bit more fleshed out.

## Development

This project requires a recent version of [node](https://nodejs.org/). In order to set it up:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:catdad/fair-compare.git
cd fair-compare
npm install
```

After that, to launch the app:

```bash
npm start
```

If you are going to be doing a lot of development and would like the app to reload/restart automatically as you change code:

```bash
npm run dev
```
